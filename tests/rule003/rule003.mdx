# Supabase documentation

Here is some Supabase documentation. It is mostly spelled correctly, but contains a notable eror.

## Testing rule-level configuration

{/* supa-mdx-lint-configure Rule003Spelling +Denethor */}

{/* supa-mdx-lint-configure-next-line Rule003Spelling +Saruman */}

Saruman is a wizard. Denethor is not.
